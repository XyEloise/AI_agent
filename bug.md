### Issue:
When using speech recognition, the first word of the speech is missing in the input field.

### How to Reproduce:
1. Click the speech-to-text button.
2. Speak a sentence such as "Hello, how are you?"
3. Notice that the first word ("Hello") is missing, and only "how are you?" is displayed in the input field.

### Expected Behavior:
The entire speech, including the first word, should be captured and displayed.
